## Proposed Project Idea

Clearly describe your idea for a final project, including what robot you plan to use, what application you focusing on and why, and include any background references you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

## Acceptance Criteria

In a bulleted list, include predefined requirements that must be met for your project to be considered complete. You must identify at least five requirements for your robotic system to satisfy the goals of the project you are setting. These requirements must be specific, easily verifiable, and be an important part of the project's success. For example, for a robot delivery system, some of the requirements might include building correct map of a specific environment, correctly delivering items to the location, and correctly returning to its base location.

## Feasibility

Explain why is your proposed idea feasible. For example, are you extending a previous project or have a sample code from someone else's project to start with?

The EvoArm has the gripper, so it can grab things up. We came to the idea that the robot's hand can grab the tiny cup to do the cup stacking challenges. Last project, we did with the EvoArm and this project we want its to do somethings beyond the starter kit. With this project, we know how to control the robot autonomously by using the python code. The first step in this project we did is having the robot pick up a cup manually, and the EvoArm can do it perfectly. Then, we will start to control the project by write the command in python. 

## Additional Hardware

If your project requires additional hardware, please list it below and include a link to a website where it can be purchased. If you need resources other than hardware, please list them as well. If you do not require any additional resources, just state that fact.

We need two more motors for the robot: the first one is for the gipper and the second one is for the wrist. Last time, when we worked with the robot the robot's hand could not open sometimes and we needed to open it manually.
