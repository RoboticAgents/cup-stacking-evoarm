# Project Proposal by Evelyn Griffith and Trang Hoang

## Proposed Project Idea

For this final project, Trang and I will be attempting to get the EvoarmMini334 to stack a series of pixie cups into a tower which the kids and people in the audience will then be allowed to knock over. This idea was thought of after getting the robot arm to successfully stack a set of three provided blocks. We thought that this project would be a good final assignment because it allows us to practice coding the evoarm and also allows us to do a practical application for the robot that will be fun for the community to watch when they come to see the robots. For this we are focusing on the coding of the robot arm. We know that it is capable of stacking things, but we thought that the added challenge of stacking them in a certain way (that requires a gentle application of the materials) would be interesting to explore. We did not have any references or background help with developing this idea. We just thought that having the robot stack cups would be interesting, and after having the evoarm successfully stack three blocks, we wanted to continue with the idea of stacking in a way that was more complex and would require more code.

## Acceptance Criteria

In a bulleted list, include predefined requirements that must be met for your project to be considered complete. You must identify at least five requirements for your robotic system to satisfy the goals of the project you are setting. These requirements must be specific, easily verifiable, and be an important part of the project's success. For example, for a robot delivery system, some of the requirements might include building correct map of a specific environment, correctly delivering items to the location, and correctly returning to its base location.

- The robot must be able to pick up a cup
- The robot must be able to place down a cup
- The robot must be able to stack one cup on top of two preplaced cups
- The robot must be able to manuver around cups that are already stacked without knocking them over
- The robon must return to its home position after stacking six cups into a cup tower

## Feasibility

Explain why is your proposed idea feasible. For example, are you extending a previous project or have a sample code from someone else's project to start with?

The EvoArm has the gripper, so it can grab things up. We came to the idea that the robot's hand can grab the tiny cup to do the cup stacking challenges. Last project, we did with the EvoArm and this project we want its to do somethings beyond the starter kit. With this project, we know how to control the robot autonomously by using the python code. The first step in this project we did is having the robot pick up a cup manually, and the EvoArm can do it perfectly. Then, we will start to control the project by write the command in python. 

## Additional Hardware

If your project requires additional hardware, please list it below and include a link to a website where it can be purchased. If you need resources other than hardware, please list them as well. If you do not require any additional resources, just state that fact.

We need two more motors for the robot: the first one is for the gipper and the second one is for the wrist. Last time, when we worked with the robot the robot's hand could not open sometimes and we needed to open it manually.
