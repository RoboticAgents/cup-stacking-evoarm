## Completed Prototype

Describe your working prototype: what can your robot currently do?

## Remaining Work

Describe what needs to be completed in order for your project to satisfy its acceptance criteria

Next time we meet, the first step we take is to let the robot do the previous task, because sometimes the robot's hardware is inconsistent. If the robot works well with previous code, we will continue to do the command so the robot can stack more cups. Last time, we have the code stacking 4 cups, in total we need to stack 6 six cups. Next step we do is coding the command for the robot to stack the last 2 cups on top of the previous cups. Finally, we will have 6 cups stack perfectly. to make a cup tower. However, if the project will not go well as we expect, we will test the previous code and get the cups in the right position we want. In the case that any hardware problem occurs, we will look at the problem and fix it as soon as possible.
